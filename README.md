# BusinessObject3

Not ment to work. Only ment to show a possible way to do orm mapping on top level.



What it is:
- A prototype mokup that i not suposed to be used
- Focus is to show an ewxample on how it should work for the end user. The exammple folder. Creeating mapping classes, ...
- Generating some SQL for those few functionalities thath will be added

What it is not:
- Dos not access db
- Shoul not be used. Not usable.
- Focus is not on the backen library, business folder. It is a tighly coupeled mess just tossed together in an atempt to get the examples to look like how I would like a ORM library to work.
